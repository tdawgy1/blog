Investopedia says, "Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of a single computer. DApps (also called "dapps") are outside the purview and control of a single authority. DApps—which are often built on the Ethereum platform—can be developed for a variety of purposes including gaming, finance, and social media."

If that made sense great, but for those who did not understand; I am here to explain. Basically a dApp either runs on a direct connection between all users, a p2p network, or it runs on a blockchain, the same thing crypto currencies run on.

This if different from the usual centralized database that big tech companies run on. A dApp gives companies no control over your data.

DApps are the new era of the internet. They will start to take off when we decide to stray away from big tech. We currently give big tech to much power and to much information to who we are. Big tech has also proven they cant be trusted with this information.

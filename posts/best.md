<h1>DRUMM3R</h1>
DRUMM3R is a decentraziled forum app that tries to bring true anomity back to forums. This dApps isnt built on a blockchain, so the crash of crypto has not affected it. It is built on a peer to peer, p2p, network, and it is very promising. It is new and experimental, however it is worth a try.

<h1>OpenSea</h1>
OpenSea is a peer-to-peer marketplace for digital assets, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It allows users to buy, sell and trade a variety of digital collectibles, including CryptoKitties, game items and other digital assets. The platform uses blockchain technology to ensure the security and transparency of all transactions. OpenSea has seen its fair share of highs and lows—obtaining a valuation of US$13 billion and coming under fire for insider trading and phishing attacks amounting to losses of over US$1.7 million. Still, with more and more people (celebrities and businesses) looking to launch NFTs, the marketplace is only set to grow this year. 

<h1>Alien Worlds</h1>
Launched in 2020, the blockchain game Alien Worlds grew from 10,000 users to five million in one year. Alien Worlds is a blockchain-based virtual world that allows users to earn rewards by playing games and completing tasks. The platform uses a variety of in-game assets, including the native token, TLM, to reward users for their contributions. In October 2021, the game became the world’s most popular blockchain game, as per a report by DappRadar. With a market cap of over US$99 million, Alien Worlds prides itself on creating an environment where communities can compete against each other and live their lives online.

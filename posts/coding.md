Depending on what you want to do with your coding changes what coding language is best for you to start with. I have narrowed coding down to 4 categories: Machine Learning, Web development, Gaming, and Cross-Platform developmemnt. For machine laerning start with python, for web dev start with javascipt, for gaming start with c#, and for cross-platform dev use dart.

<h1>Python</h1>
Python is my personal favorite language, however with my new ventrue in web dev I have been using javascript a little more. Python has the biggest community while being the most begginer friendly language. If you want to start with learning python go to youtube and watch Programming with Mosh full 6 hour course. Then watch tech with tim for most advanced concepts. This is how I personally got started.

<h1>Javascript</h1>
This has language has become my mistress to python. With my recent venture into web dev I have grown to love and appreciate python. It is very similar to python except you need to also learn html(page format) and css(page styling), or tailwind which is an article for a different day. Even though these languages take a total of 30 minutes to learn the absolute basics, css is a language that causes me mental break downs and takes porbably longer to master than it takes to master javascript. All in all if you are looking to do web dev starting with vanilla javascript is your best best than learn react the bets framew work, then next which is built ontop of react.

<h1>C#</h1>
I havent even tried c#, but it is the number 1 language for creating games. To start, you are going to want to use unity or unreal engine to create your games.

<h1>Dart</h1>
Dart is the language that flutter runs on. Flutter is  a dart frame work made by google that allows you to create ios, andriod, and web apps with 1 code base. I just learning dart and I'm liking it.
